We live in an era where people rely heavily on online reviews and ratings when making decisions about where to stay during their travels. The star rating system, in particular, can significantly impact a hotel’s reputation and success in attracting guests. However, despite the relevance and significance of these star ratings, there is still a lack of comprehensive understanding regarding the factors that contribute to their determination.
With this in mind, we have decided to delve into the data around hotels in Las Vegas, a city known for its vibrant and ever-evolving hospitality industry. By analyzing this dataset, we believe that we can uncover valuable insights into the key factors influencing a hotel’s star rating.
